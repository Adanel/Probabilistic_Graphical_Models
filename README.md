# Probabilistic_Graphical_Models

Course *Introduction to Probabilistic Graphical Models* taught at Telecom Paristech by [Pr. Umut Simsekli](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/simsekli/) in the context of the Master Data Science, a Master delivered by *Ecole Polytechnique*

This course addresses the following topics:

Hidden Markov Models (Modelisation, Forward-Backward algorithms in theory & practice)
Gaussian Mixture Models (Clustering, Expectation-Maximization algorithms in theory & practice)
In this repository, you will find 2 projects:

- Lab1: Simulation of a moving robot, the position of which is probabilistic, and not always known to the user... With the probability model known and a set of observations, how can we find the most likely-position at any time using Hidden Markov Models ?
- Lab2: the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm from scratch. Mathematical theory and code implementation.

Labs were done with [Guillaume Desforges](https://github.com/GuillaumeDesforges).
